Perhaps I hadn't been the best or most devoted of sisters, but Respen was the one who had taken me to Waterdeep, plucked me starving from the forest.  His kindness was my life.  I could not bear him perishing for my stupidity.  He could not.  He would not.  But neither could he be resurrected, or even so much as healed.  It was the Time of Troubles, remember.~

It poured with rain that night, lashings of it, extinguishing the street lamps and soaking my skirts.  I pulled until I screamed with frustration, until blood trickled from beneath my nails.

It was a wonder I was not instantly sucked dry, but I undoubtedly intrigued him...and I begged him, at any cost, to save Respen.  And I suppose he did, in some sense.  He sired him, breathed into him a vampiric half-life worse then death.  I should have thought.  As I say, we do foolish things for...for love.~
